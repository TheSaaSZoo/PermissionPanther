# Log-based Metrics

Permission Panther logs semi-structured access for namespaces. This can be used to determine how specific namespaces are utilizing Permission Panther. At least one log will be generated for every action, often with more logs for sub-actions to maintain consistentcy of checking logs.

For example you can calculate the average recursions of a permission lookup, or determine how often users are inviting others to projects. You can view the throughput of different functions, and build access patterns to show how your app is used throughout the day.
