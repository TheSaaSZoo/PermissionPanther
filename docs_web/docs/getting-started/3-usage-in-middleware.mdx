# Usage in Middleware

Permission Panther was designed to be implemented directly in your route handlers, or in middleware.

If you have a consistent URL pattern, middleware is the most convenient place to place your checks.

## Example ExpressJS Middleware

Lets say we have the following API that allows users to share files with their friends and colleagues.

We can create middleware, that based on a predictable URL scheme, can check whether a user has a given permission on an object in just a few lines of code:

```js
const {PermissionPantherClient} = require('permissionpanther')
const client = new PermissionPanther('UXVI4...', 'vsfQE...')

const app = require('express')()

async function CheckPermissionMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Based on the URL scheme check permissions
  const action = req.originalURL.split('/')[1]
  const check = await client.CheckPermission(req.user.id, action, req.params.objectID)
  if !check.valid {
    // They do not have permission to perform this action
    return res.sendStatus(403)
  } else {
    // They have permission, continue
    next()
  }
}

app.get('/view/{objectID}', CheckPermissionMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // A user can pull the file content, and any associated metadata
})

app.post('/comment/{objectID}', CheckPermissionMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // A user can create a new comment on the file
})

app.delete('/delete/{objectID}', CheckPermissionMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // A user can delete the file
})

```
