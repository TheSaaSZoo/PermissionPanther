# Problems Permission Panther Solves

## Multi-Tenancy Management

Whether you are building managed kubernetes observability, a revolutionary cloud platform, or analytics tools, you need to have you users be able to share access to your product.

Permission Panther allows project owners to invite other users to their projects, without complex permission management. You can give them varying permissions to allow/prevent them using certain features, and what they can see.

Allow your tenants to share without interferring with other tenants, ensure that they can only access the actions and data they are explicily permitted to, and nothing else.

## Content Sharing

Whether it is social media, git repos, or you are building the next google drive, you need to control what your users can do.

Permission Panther can provide you with the access control to determine who can view posts, comment on files, or edit all documents in a folder. What ever actions you may need, Permission Panther ensures users have them.

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

ReBAC can do everything that RBAC can do, with far less code, and far more functionality.

## Physical Access Control

Just because it’s software, doesn’t mean it can’t work in the real world!

Permission Panther can be your go-to solution for managing access to physical infrastructure. Whether it be an office building, a single door, or giving support technicians temporary access to on-site locations with Relation TTLs.

Permission Panther can control access to physical objects just as well as it can control access to software!

## Support Agent Management

For some services, support agents shouldn’t have the ability to access data or infrastructure without explicit approval of customers.

Permission Panther can allow for temporary access to customer data, along with limited functionality, so support agents only have the access they need. You can even have various levels of support agent escallation with Permission Groups, so that escallation to increased access and duration only occurs as situations require.

## Premium Feature Access

Instead of checking what subscription a user has in every request, give users with higher subscription tiers specific permissions to access certain features. Protect your premium features with a single line of code. With Permission Groups you can define what access a subscription tier has.

## Feature Flagging

When accessing a new feature, check if they have permission to a new or old version.
