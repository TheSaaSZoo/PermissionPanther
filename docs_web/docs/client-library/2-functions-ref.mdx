# Functions Reference

See the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide for setting up the client library.

If you are intending on pointing to a self-managed instance, you will need to add some additional options to your client library initialization to point there like so:

```js
const {PermissionPantherClient} = require('permissionpanther')
const client = new PermissionPantherClient('UXVI4...', 'vsfQE...', {
  endpoint: "https://my.instance.com",
})
```

You may also optionally turn TLS security off. THIS IS NOT RECCOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION.

```js
const {PermissionPantherClient} = require('permissionpanther')
const client = new PermissionPantherClient('UXVI4...', 'vsfQE...', {
  endpoint: "http://my.instance.com",
  insecure: true
})
```

## `client.CheckPermission()`

Checks whether a relation exists.

Optionally disbale inheritance checks which will restrict the check to a single explicit permission check (there must be an exact permission grant).

Optionally pass a `denyPermission` to specify whether an explicit denial should be checked for as well. If found, the result will always return `valid: false`.

Returns whether the permission was found, and after how many recursions. A `.recursion` of `0` means that they had explicit permission, and `-1` mean it was not found (maximum recursion reached).

Example:

```js
await client.CheckPermission("user1", "access", "obj2")
// { valid: true, recursion: 0 }
```

## `client.SetPermission()`

Set a relation. This is a no-op if the relation already exists. Returns whether the relation was created.

Example:

```js
await client.SetPermission("user1", "access", "obj2")
// true
```

## `client.RemovePermission()`

Removes a permission, returning whether the permission was successfully removed.

Example:

```js
await client.RemovePermission("user1", "access", "obj2")
```

## `client.Inherit()`

Creates an [Inheritance](/docs/getting-started/concepts#inheritance-and-recursion) relation when used as the `entity` in [client.SetPermission()](#clientsetpermission). Returns an `entity`.

Example:

```js
await client.SetPermission(client.Inherit("read", "folder_1"),"read", "file_1_1")
```

This example translates to:

> Any entity that has the permission `read` on object `folder_1` has the `read` permission on the object `file_1_1`.

View the [Inheritance concepts section](/docs/getting-started/concepts#inheritance-and-recursion) for more.

## `client.ListEntityRelations()`

List the relations for a given `entity`, optionally specifying the `permission` to filter on, and an `offset` as the number of relations to start listing after. Returns an array of relations.

Example:

```js
await client.ListEntityRelations("user1", {
  permission: "access"
})
```

This example translates to:

> List all of the relations where `user1` has `access`.

:::warning
The interface for setting the `offset` will change in the future, as LIMIT/OFFSET based pagination is not scalable.
:::

## `client.ListObjectRelations()`

List the relations for a given `object`, optionally specifying the `permission` to filter on, and an `offset` as the number of relations to start listing after. Returns an array of relations.

Example:

```js
await client.ListObjectRelations("object1", {
  permission: "access",
  offset: 10
})
```

This example translates to:

> List all of the relations where an entity has `access` on `object1`, starting after the first 10 relations.

:::warning
The interface for setting the `offset` will change in the future, as LIMIT/OFFSET based pagination is not scalable.
:::

## `client.CreatePermissionGroup()`

Creates a new [Permission Group](/docs/getting-started/concepts#permission-groups), optionally including initial permissions to add to the group. Returns whether the Permission Group was created.

Example:

```js
await client.CreatePermissionGroup("editor", ["read", "write", "comment"])
```

## `client.DeletePermissionGroup()`

Deletes a permission group, optionally `propagate` changes to members (entities) of the group.

Example:

```js
await client.DeletePermissionGroup("editor", true)
```

:::warning
The `propagate` parameter should be `false` if adding a permission to a group with many members, as any group that takes longer than 60 seconds to update will timeout and the transaction will be aborted.

In the future an async update option will be included. For now this should be combined with [`client.ListEntitiesInPermissionGroup()`](#clientlistentitiesinpermissiongroup) to manually propagate permission at scale.
:::


## `client.AddPermissionToGroup()`

Adds a permission to a Permission Group, returning whether the permission was added (if it did not already exist in the group). The `propagate` parameter determines whether the added permission will given to existing members of the permission group.

Example:

```js
await client.AddPermissionToGroup("editor", "suggest", true)
```

:::warning
The `propagate` parameter should be `false` if adding a permission to a group with many members, as any group that takes longer than 60 seconds to update will timeout and the transaction will be aborted.

In the future an async update option will be included. For now this should be combined with [`client.ListEntitiesInPermissionGroup()`](#clientlistentitiesinpermissiongroup) to manually propagate permission at scale.
:::

## `client.RemovePermissionFromGroup()`

Removes a permission from a Permission Group, returning whether the permission was removed (if existed in the group). The `propagate` parameter determines whether the added permission will removed from existing members of the permission group.

Example:

```js
await client.RemovePermissionFromGroup("editor", "suggest", true)
```

:::warning
The `propagate` parameter should be `false` if removing a permission from a group with many members, as any group that takes longer than 60 seconds to update will timeout and the transaction will be aborted.

In the future an async update option will be included. For now this should be combined with [`client.ListEntitiesInPermissionGroup()`](#clientlistentitiesinpermissiongroup) to manually propagate permission at scale.
:::

## `client.ListEntitiesInPermissionGroup()`

Lists the members (entities) of a permission group, optionally providing an `entityOffset` for pagination. Returns a maximum 50 results.

Example:

```js
await client.ListEntitiesInPermissionGroup("editor")
```

## `client.PermissionGroup()`

Returns a specially formatted `permission` to indicate that a Permission Group is being. When used with [client.SetPermission()](#clientsetpermission) you add the `entity` as a member of the Permission Group, giving them all permissions that are in the group. Returns a `permission`.

Example:

```js
await client.SetPermission("user1", client.PermissionGroup("editor"), "folder_1")
```

This gives the entity `user1` all permissions in the permission group `editor` on the object `folder_1`.

Likewise the permission group can be removed by combining with [client.RemovePermission()](#clientremovetpermission) like so:

```js
await client.RemovePermission("user1", client.PermissionGroup("editor"), "folder_1")
```

View the [Permission Groups concepts section](/docs/getting-started/concepts#permission-groups) for more.
